## Title

<b>My Amazing Science Project!<b>
Author: S. Strong, PhD
Location: Bellevue, WA

## Plan:

I want to determine if I can make a robot get snacks for me. This robot needs to be able to use voice commands to navigate thgouh the house, from my room, to the kitchen. It must pick up a snack on the floor. I would like to determine, using only $25 in parts, how heavy a snack I can get the robot to pick up and how fast he can get it back to me.

## Hypothesis:

I think the robot will be pretty small and probably can't lift a large snack. I would like to determine if I can get this robot to bring back a sandwich bag of goldfish crackers in < 1 min.

## Background:

I have conducted some research that is leading me to believe I can do this. I am putting it all here...

## Materials

I will need:

* 1 cardboard box
* 1 raspberry pi ....

## Procedure

This was the process I used. I will be very detailed in describing what I did to create this robot.

## Data Analysis

Here I will show the results of my snack testing. How fast was it? Could I get him to pick anything up? I will make sure to include charts and graphs.

## Conclusion & Future Ideas

I will discuss if it worked or not. I'd also like to try some modifications in the future...

## References

All the websites, books, magazines, and people who I consulted.
