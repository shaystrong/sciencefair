Kids 13+ years old are encouraged to create public Github repositories and submit the link upon entering their results. 

The judges are a mixture of Data Scientists, Astronomers, and Software Developers at EV.

### Project types:
All types of projects are welcome, but we encourage an emphasis on engineering, computer science, data science, and coronavirus projects. Why corona virus you ask? – because there is a lot of amazing data. We want to see you ask questions and help us understand why we are all stuck at home.
